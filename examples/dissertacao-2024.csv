Interpreting Regulations with SBVR.|Elie Abi-Lahoud, Elie Abi-Lahoud, Tom Butler, Tom Butler, Donald Chapin, Donald Chapin, John William Hall, John Hall|2013|The wide and complex spectrum of regulations, especially in the financial services industry, calls for machine assistance in making sense of, and in consuming, regulatory text. This paper describes an approach to interpreting regulations with SBVR. The purpose is to clarify ambiguity in regulations by developing a shared vocabulary and shared guidance based on the regulatory text. The on-going work presented in this paper is part of the Governance, Risk and Compliance Technology Centre’s (Ireland) current research activities that include the development of policy advice on compliance with US Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations for companies that are governed by these regulations. The approach is based on the navigation of US public databases – Federal Register, Code of Federal Regulations and US Code – to identify subsets of AML regulation relevant to companies based outside the USA. These subsets are imported into an SBVR toolset, where they are analysed and, if necessary, interpreted by the legal and financial experts on the team. A standardized vocabulary for AML is being developed in SBVR, together with advice on regulatory intent and formal expression of rules with which regulated companies must comply.|||||||null|Abi-Lahoud_2013||||International Web Rule Symposium|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Domain-specific knowledge graphs: A survey|Bilal Abu-Salih, Bilal Abu-Salih|2021|Abstract Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have made a qualitative leap and effected a real revolution in knowledge representation. This is leveraged by the underlying structure of the KG which underpins a better comprehension, reasoning and interpretation of knowledge for both human and machine. Therefore, KGs continue to be used as the main means of tackling a plethora of real-life problems in various domains. However, there is no consensus in regard to a plausible and inclusive definition of a domain-specific KG. Further, in conjunction with several limitations and deficiencies, various domain-specific KG construction approaches are far from perfect. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive definition of a domain-specific KG. Also, the paper presents a thorough review of the state-of-the-art approaches drawn from academic works relevant to seven domains of knowledge. An examination of current approaches reveals a range of limitations and deficiencies. At the same time, uncharted territories on the research map are highlighted to tackle extant issues in the literature and point to directions for future research.|||||||10.1016/j.jnca.2021.103076|Abu-Salih_2021||||Journal of Network and Computer Applications|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
MDA Approach: Refinement and Validation of CIM Level Using SBVR|Najiba Addamssiri, Najiba Addamssiri, Abdelouhaed Kriouile, Abdelouhaed Kriouile, Sara Boussaa, Sara Boussaa, Taoufiq Gadi, Taoufiq Gadi|2016|Any change in the software based on business logic affects all MDA levels: CIM, PIM and PSM. This paper provides an approach to refine and validate CIM for enabling a premature customer’s validation. We propose a set of rules for generating BPMN Model from use cases model which represent both of them our CIM. This transformation uses SBVR as an intermediate step. Firstly, we generate SBVR model from use case model and its textual description and secondly we transform it to BPMN model. SBVR represents the axe of the CIM refinement cycle, which is based on a natural language that is easily comprehensible and usable by business people and easily can be machine processed. Validated and refined CIM’s achieves a high customer satisfaction, and allowing a better vision of the product as the customer expects.|||||||10.1007/978-3-319-30298-0_41|Addamssiri_2016||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Generating UML Class Models from SBVR Software Requirements Specifications|Hina Afreen, Imran Sarwar Bajwa|2011|SBVR is the recent standard, introduced by OMG that can be used to capture software requirements in a natural language (NL) such as English. In this paper, we present a novel approach that can translate SBVR specification of software requirements into UML class models. We want to generate UML class models from SBVR specifications instead of NL specifications of software requirements as NL to UML translation exhibit lesser accuracy due to informal nature of natural languages. SBVR specifications can be quite helpful as SBVR is not only based on higher-order logic and easy to machine process but also easy to understand for human beings. The presented approach works as the user inputs the SBVR specification of software requirements and then the input SBVR is syntactically and semantically analyzed to extract OO information and finally OO information is mapped to a class model. The presented approach is also presented in a prototype tool SBVR2UML that is an Eclipse plugin and a proof of concept. A case study has also been solved to show that the use of SBVR in automated generation of class models provide better accuracy and consistency as compared with other available approaches.|||||||null|Afreen_2011||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
SBVR2UML: A Challenging Transformation|Hina Afreen, Hina Afreen, Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Behzad Bordbar, Behzad Bordbar|2011|UML is a de-facto standard used for generating the software models. UML support visualization of the software artifacts. To generate a UML diagram, a software engineer has to collect software requirements in a natural language (such as English) or a semi-formal language (such as SBVR), manually analyze the requirements and then manually generate the class diagrams in an available CASE tool. However, by automatically transforming SBVR Software requirements to UML can seriously share burden of a system analyst and can improve the quality and robustness of software modeling phase. The paper demonstrates the challenging aspect of model transformation from SBVR to UML. The presented approach takes input the software requirements specified in SBVR syntax, parses the input specification, extracts the UML ingredients such as classes, methods, attributes, associations, etc and finally generate the visual representation of the extracted information. The presented approach is fully automated. The presented approach is explained via an example.|||||||10.1109/fit.2011.14|Afreen_2011b||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
An Intelligent Approach for CRC Models Based Agile Software Requirement Engineering Using SBVR|Hina Afreen, Hina Afreen, Hina Afreen, Umer Farooq, Umer Farooq, Umer Farooq|2020|In requirement engineering (RE) for agile software development, the Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) models are used as important brainstorming tool. However, manual generation of such CRC models by analyzing the requirements is a difficult and time-consuming task due to ambiguity and informal nature of natural languages-based software requirements. This paper introduces an improved requirement engineering technique based on CRC models that can help in specifying and analyzing software requirements in a better and faster way and curtailing difficulties associated with the traditional RE analysis technique. The proposed technique employs Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) to capture and specify software requirements in a controlled natural language. The SBVR representation is processed to extract object-oriented information and map the extracted information to CRC models in both textual and visual form. The proposed approach is implemented as an Eclipse plugin prototype SBVR2CRC as a proof of concept and the results of the experiments validate the effectiveness of the presented approach. Results show that such automated approach not only saves certain time and effort but also assists in generation of better CRC models and simplifies the CRC models based agile software development.|||||||10.1007/978-981-15-5232-8_32|Afreen_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Legislative Compliance Assessment: Framework, Model and GDPR Instantiation|Sushant Agarwal, Sushant Agarwal, Simon Steyskal, Simon Steyskal, Franjo Antunovic, Franjo Antunovic, Sabrina Kirrane, Sabrina Kirrane|2018|Legislative compliance assessment tools are commonly used by companies to help them to understand their legal obligations. One of the primary limitations of existing tools is that they tend to consider each regulation in isolation. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular compliance assessment framework that can support multiple legislations. Additionally, we describe our extension of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) so that it can be used not only to represent digital rights but also legislative obligations, and discuss how the proposed model is used to develop a flexible compliance system, where changes to the obligations are automatically reflected in the compliance assessment tool. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through the development of a General Data Protection Regulatory model and compliance assessment tool.|||||||10.1007/978-3-030-02547-2_8|Agarwal_2018||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Modelling semantic profiles in legislative documents for enhanced norm accessibility|Tommaso Agnoloni, Tommaso Agnoloni, Enrico Francesconi, Enrico Francesconi|2011|In this paper an approach to the Semantic Web in the legal domain is discussed: it is obtained by modelling legislative document semantic profiles using a model of normative provisions.

In particular, an implementation of Hohfeldian legal fundamental relations between provisions, as well as a reasoning example by using the proposed approach is shown.|||||||10.1145/2018358.2018374|Agnoloni_2011||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Can Knowledge Graphs Reduce Hallucinations in LLMs? : A Survey|Garima Agrawal, Tharindu Kumarage, Zeyad Alghami, Huan Liu|2023|The contemporary LLMs are prone to producing hallucinations, stemming mainly from the knowledge gaps within the models. To address this critical limitation, researchers employ diverse strategies to augment the LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, aiming to reduce hallucinations and enhance reasoning accuracy. Among these strategies, leveraging knowledge graphs as a source of external information has demonstrated promising results. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of these knowledge-graph-based knowledge augmentation techniques in LLMs, focusing on their efficacy in mitigating hallucinations. We systematically categorize these methods into three overarching groups, offering both methodological comparisons and empirical evaluations of their performance. Lastly, the paper explores the challenges associated with these techniques and outlines potential avenues for future research in this emerging field.|||||||10.48550/arxiv.2311.07914|Agrawal_2023||||arXiv.org|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
The European Legal Taxonomy Syllabus: A multi-lingual, multi-level ontology framework to untangle the web of European legal terminology|Gianmaria Ajani, Gianmaria Ajani, Guido Boella, Guido Boella, Luigi Di, Luigi Di Caro, Livio Robaldo, Livio Robaldo, Llio Humphreys, Llio Humphreys, Sabrina Praduroux, Sabrina Praduroux, Piercarlo Rossi, Piercarlo Rossi, Piercarlo Rossi, Andrea Violato, Andrea Violato|2017|This paper describes a new concept of legal ontology together with an ontology development tool, called the European Legal Taxonomy Syllabus (ELTS). The tool is used to model the legal terminology created by the Uniform Terminology project on EU consumer protection law as an ontology. ELTS is not a formal ontology in the standard sense, i.e., an axiomatic ontology formalized, for instance, in description logic. Rather, it is a lightweight ontology, i.e. a knowledge base storing low-level legal concepts, connected via low-level semantic relations, and related to linguistic patterns that denote legal concepts in several languages spoken in the European Union (EU). In other words, ELTS is a multi-lingual and multi-jurisdictional terminological vocabulary enriched with concepts denoted by vocabulary entries, with semantic relations between different concepts. The choice of such an architecture is based on past studies in comparative law and is motivated by the need to reveal the differences between national systems within the EU. Past literature in comparative law highlights that axiomatic ontologies freeze legal knowledge in an unreal steadiness, i.e., they render it disconnected from legal practice. Much more flexibility is needed to make the knowledge base acceptable to legal practitioners. ELTS was developed together with legal practitioners on the basis of the comparative view of European law. The ontology framework is designed to help professionals study the meaning of national and European legal terms and how they inter-relate in the transposition of European Directives into national laws. The structure and user interface of ELTS is suitable for building multi-lingual, multi-jurisdictional legal ontologies in a bottom-up and collaborative manner, starting from the description of legal terms by legal experts. It also takes into account the interpretation of norms, the dynamic character of norms and the contextual character of legal concepts in that they are linked to their legal sources (legislation, case law and doctrine).|||||||10.3233/ao-170174|Ajani_2017||||Applied Ontology|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

To write even a simple transformation, these MTFs require a large amount of learning time. We describe in this paper a minimal, Java based, library that can be used to support the implementation of many practical transformations. Use of this library enables simple transformations to be implemented simply, whilst still providing some support for more complex transformations.|||||||10.1007/11880240_25|Akehurst_2006||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Finding the Law: Enhancing Statutory Article Retrieval via Graph Neural Networks|Louis Antoine, Gijs Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis|2023|Statutory article retrieval (SAR), the task of retrieving statute law articles relevant to a legal question, is a promising application of legal text processing. In particular, high-quality SAR systems can improve the work efficiency of legal professionals and provide basic legal assistance to citizens in need at no cost. Unlike traditional ad-hoc information retrieval, where each document is considered a complete source of information, SAR deals with texts whose full sense depends on complementary information from the topological organization of statute law. While existing works ignore these domain-specific dependencies, we propose a novel graph-augmented dense statute retriever (G-DSR) model that incorporates the structure of legislation via a graph neural network to improve dense retrieval performance. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms strong retrieval baselines on a real-world expert-annotated SAR dataset.|||||||10.48550/arxiv.2301.12847|Antoine_2023||||Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

SBVR Business Rules Generation from Natural Language Specification|Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Mark Lee, Mark Lee, Behzad Bordbar, Behzad Bordbar|2011|In this paper, we present a novel approach of translating natural languages specification to SBVR business rules. The business rules constraint business structure or control behaviour of a business process. In modern business modelling, one of the important phases is writing business rules.

SBVR vs OCL: A comparative analysis of standards|Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Behzad Bordbar, Mark Lee|2011|In software modelling, the designers have to produce UML visual models with software constraints. Similarly, in business modelling, designers have to model business processes using business constraints (business rules). Constraints are the key components in the skeleton of business or software models. A designer has to write constraints to semantically compliment business models or UML models and finally implementing the constraints into business processes or source code. Business constraints/rules can be written using SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules) while OCL (Object Constraint Language) is the well-known medium for writing software constraints. SBVR and OCL are two significant standards from OMG. Both standards are principally different as SBVR is typically used in business domains and OCL is employed to compliment software models. However, we have identified a few similarities in both standards that are interesting to study. In this paper, we have performed a comparative analysis of both standards as we are looking for a mechanism for automatic transformation of SBVR to OCL. The major emphasis of the study is to highlight principal features of SBVR and OCL such as similarities, differences and key parameters on which these both standards can work together.|||||||10.1109/inmic.2011.6151485|Bajwa_2011a||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

On a chain of transformations for generating alloy from NL constraints|Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Imran Sarwar Bajwa, Behzad Bordbar, Behzad Bordbar, Kyriakos Anastasakis, Kyriakos Anastasakis, Mark Lee, Mark Lee|2012|Multi-Paradigm Modelling uses models from multiple domains to leverage the tools, techniques and expertise provided by each of the individual domains. Recent advances in model transformation technology allow automated production of one model from another to improve the application of multi-paradigm techniques. Systems development starts with the requirements gathering phase, which usually comprises of a textual description of the system requirements provided in Natural Language (NL). It is therefore evident that there is a clear scope for incorporating NL Processing techniques in Multi- Paradigm Modeling. However, using NLP methods pushes the boundaries of Multi-Paradigm Modeling to an extreme; indeed NLs are inherently ambiguous and open to interpretation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on standards (such as SBVR) that can cope with syntactic and semantic ambiguities in NL specifications and can map them to formal languages such as Alloy.

Such intermediate translations help us to monitor the whole process of translation and produce intermediate artifacts such as OCL constraints, which can be used for documentation purposes. and ensure that actual semantics of NL have been transformed to Alloy. The generated Alloy code can then be used to check if the original NL constraints are consistent. We also introduce the use of OMG's standard SBVR in translation of NL to formal languages.

To minimize such errors, we propose a novel method to mine the documents automatically to extract the fundamental atomic facts in every sentence - called as business rule intents. We adopt dependency tree parser to parse the rule sentences and extract rule intents from them. Our experiments using few publicly available sample documents in the financial domain yielded very promising results, where rule intents extraction produced an average precision of 78% and recall of 80%.|||||||10.1145/3021460.3021470|Bhattacharyya_2017||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Relation Identification in Business Rules for Domain-specific Documents|Abhidip Bhattacharyya, Abhidip Bhattacharyya, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Ravindra Naik, Ravindra Naik|2018|This paper focuses on an approach to mine business rules from documents and facilitates a methodology to represent them in a formal notation. Businesses are operated abiding by some rules and complying with respect to regulation and guidelines. The business rules are often written using English in operating procedures, terms and conditions, and various other supporting documents. The manual analysis of these rules for activities like impact analysis, maintenance, business transformation leads to potential discrepancies, ambiguities, and quality issues. In this paper, we discuss our approach of mining relations among the rule intents (atomic facts) defined for business rules. We also present our preliminary studies on a couple of openly available documents.|||||||10.1145/3172871.3172884|Bhattacharyya_2018||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

This is mainly due to a historical focus on general purpose legal ontologies that do not capture the variety of definitions and interpretations that apply in different contexts, and a focus on automated extraction over manual verification in a domain where accuracy is of utmost importance. In this paper, we show how the use of a domain-specific ontology within a sophisticated legal monitoring software managed by legal experts can help compliance officers in banks and insurance companies comply with strict regulatory duties in a highly complex and constantly evolving area of law.|||||||10.1007/978-3-7908-2789-7_62|Boella_2012||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

From UML/OCL to SBVR specifications: A challenging transformation|Jordi Cabot, Jordi Cabot, Jordi Cabot, Jordi Cabot, Raquel Pau, Raquel Pau, Ruth Raventós, Ruth Raventós|2010|UML is currently the most widely used modeling language for the specification of the conceptual schema (CS) of an information system (IS). However, UML falls short when it comes to allow business people to define in their own language (e.g. using their own terms in natural language) the policies and rules by which they run their business. To this purpose, the semantics of business vocabulary and business rules (SBVR) metamodel specification was proposed. SBVR is conceptualized optimally for business people and it is designed to be used for business purposes, independently of information systems designs. Clearly, SBVR and unified modeling language (UML) cannot be considered as isolated languages. Many of the business rules specified by business people must be automatically executed by the underlying information system, and thus, they must also appear in its UML CS. In this sense, the main goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between UML and SBVR by providing an automatic transformation from UML to SBVR specifications. Thanks to our transformation, designers will be able to interact with the business people (in their own language) to refine and validate the information modeled in the CS before the generation of the final IS implementation. Our transformation also takes into account all possible textual object constraint language (OCL) expressions that complement the UML graphical elements.|||||||10.1016/j.is.2008.12.002|Cabot_2010||||Information Systems|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Domain-independent method of detecting inconsistencies in SBVR-based business rules|Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Kritika Anand, Kritika Anand|2016|Traditionally, business rules are expressed informally in English, captured eventually, as a part of UML use-cases. Detecting anomalies in business rules is extremely difficult to automate, due to their informal nature, and manually error-prone due to the size and complexity. In recent times, business rules are being expressed increasingly using standard representations (such as Semantics of Business Vocabularies and Rules (SBVR)). We present a method to detect inconsistencies amongst the rules, based on the model checking. We exploit the First Order Logic (FOL) basis of SBVR representation to propose a method that is independent of the business domain.

Our approach is based on the assumption that verbs pose more or less strong selectional restrictions on their arguments. The conceptual hierarchy is then built on the basis of the inclusion relations between the extensions of the selectional restrictions of all the verbs, while the verbs themselves provide intensional descriptions for each concept. We formalize this idea in terms of FCA and show how our approach can be used to acquire a concept hierarchy for the tourism domain out of texts.

Extending drag-and-drop actions-based model-to-model transformations with natural language processing|Paulius Danènas, Paulius Danenas, Tomas Skersys, Tomas Skersys, Rimantas Butleris, Rimantas Butleris|2020|Model-to-model (M2M) transformations are among the key components of model-driven development, enabling a certain level of automation in the process of developing models. The developed solution of using drag-and-drop actions-based M2M transformations contributes to this purpose by providing a flexible, reusable, customizable, and relatively easy-to-use transformation method and tool support. The solution uses model-based transformation specifications triggered by user-initiated drag-and-drop actions within the model deployed in a computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tool environment. The transformations are called partial M2M transformations, meaning that a specific user-defined fragment of the source model is being transformed into a specific fragment of the target model and not running the whole model-level transformation. In this paper, in particular, we present the main aspects of the developed extension to that M2M transformation method, delivering a set of natural language processing (NLP) techniques on both the conceptual and implementation level. The paper addresses relevant developments and topics in the field of natural language processing and presents a set of operators that can be used to satisfy the needs of advanced textual preprocessing in the scope of M2M transformations. Also in this paper, we describe the extensions to the previous M2M transformation metamodel necessary for enabling the solution’s NLP-related capabilities. The usability and actual benefits of the proposed extension are introduced by presenting a set of specific partial M2M transformation use cases where natural language processing provides actual solutions to previously unsolvable situations when using the previous M2M transformation development.|||||||10.3390/app10196835|Danènas_2020||||Applied Sciences|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Out-of-Vocabulary Entities in Link Prediction.|Caglar Demir, Caglar Demir, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo|2021|Knowledge graph embedding techniques are key to making knowledge graphs amenable to the plethora of machine learning approaches based on vector representations. Link prediction is often used as a proxy to evaluate the quality of these embeddings. Given that the creation of benchmarks for link prediction is a time-consuming endeavor, most work on the subject matter uses only a few benchmarks. As benchmarks are crucial for the fair comparison of algorithms, ensuring their quality is tantamount to providing a solid ground for developing better solutions to link prediction and ipso facto embedding knowledge graphs. First studies of benchmarks pointed to limitations pertaining to information leaking from the development to the test fragments of some benchmark datasets. We spotted a further common limitation of three of the benchmarks commonly used for evaluating link prediction approaches: out-of-vocabulary entities in the test and validation sets. We provide an implementation of an approach for spotting and removing such entities and provide corrected versions of the datasets WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10. Our experiments on the corrected versions of WN18RR, FB15K-237, and YAGO3-10 suggest that the measured performance of state-of-the-art approaches is altered significantly with p-values <1%, <1.4%, and <1%, respectively. Overall, state-of-the-art approaches gain on average absolute $3.29 \pm 0.24\%$ in all metrics on WN18RR. This means that some of the conclusions achieved in previous works might need to be revisited.

Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs with Neural Machine Translation and Entity Linking.|Daniel Diomedi, Daniel Diomedi, Aidan Hogan, Aidan Hogan, Aidan Hogan|2021|The goal of Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to find answers for natural language questions over a knowledge graph. Recent KGQA approaches adopt a neural machine translation (NMT) approach, where the natural language question is translated into a structured query language. However, NMT suffers from the out-of-vocabulary problem, where terms in a question may not have been seen during training, impeding their translation. This issue is particularly problematic for the millions of entities that large knowledge graphs describe. We rather propose a KGQA approach that delegates the processing of entities to entity linking (EL) systems. NMT is then used to create a query template with placeholders that are filled by entities identified in an EL phase. Slot filling is used to decide which entity fills which placeholder. Experiments for QA over Wikidata show that our approach outperforms pure NMT: while there remains a strong dependence on having seen similar query templates during training, errors relating to entities are greatly reduced.|||||||null|Diomedi_2021||||arXiv: Artificial Intelligence|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

We use Sunflower, which is built on top of the Flora-2 knowledge representation languages and reasoner, to add automation to the compliance lifecycle. Sunflower is domain-agnostic, and financial regulatory compliance is one of its many application areas.|||||||10.1145/2993318.2993329|Ford_2016||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

A Systematic Mapping of the Literature on Legal Core Ontologies.|Cristine Griffo, Cristine Griffo, João Paulo A. Almeida, João Paulo A. Almeida, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Giancarlo Guizzardi|2015|Over the last decades, the field of legal ontologies has seen a sharp increase in the number of published papers. The literature on legal ontologies now covers a wide variety of topics and research approaches. One of these topics is legal core ontologies, which have received significant attention since the 1990s. In order to provide an up-to-date overview of this research area, this article presents a systematic mapping study of published researches on legal core ontologies. The selected papers were analyzed and categorized according to the perspective of their main contribution as well as according to the legal theories used. The study reveals that only a small number of studies use legal theories suitable to address current societal challenges.|||||||null|Griffo_2015||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Legal Theories and Judicial Decision-Making: An Ontological Analysis|Cristine Griffo, Cristine Griffo, Cristine Griffo, João Paulo A. Almeida, João Paulo A. Almeida, Giancarlo Guizzardi, Giancarlo Guizzardi|2020|In this paper, we expose the legal theories underlying two important classes of Legal Core Ontologies and show how these ontologies inherit both limitations and benefits (such as explanatory power) of their underlying theories. We do that with the help of a real case study in which we have normative omission and collision of principles. We use this case study to conduct an ontological analysis of the support for judicial decision-making in LKIF-Core (representing Kelsen’s Pure Theory of the Law) and UFO-L (representing Robert Alexy’s Theory of Constitutional Rights). We show that UFO-L is able to articulate the semantics of the content of judicial decisions by making explicit the individual’s legal positions that are raised in argumentation along a legal process. The same cannot be said of LKIF-Core that is based on the Kelsenian stance and focuses on the representation of general norms (norm types) and subsumption of facts to these norms.|||||||10.3233/faia200661|Griffo_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Automatic Extraction of SBVR Based Business Vocabulary from Natural Language Business Rules|Abdellatif Haj, Abdellatif Haj, Youssef Balouki, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadi, Taoufiq Gadi|2018|In the early phases of software development, both of business analysts and IT architects collaborate to define the business needs in a consistent and unambiguous format before exploiting them to produce a software solution to the problem have been defined. Given the divergence of the interest areas of each intervenor, the natural language remains the most adequate format to define the business needs in order to avoid misunderstanding. This informal support suffers from ambiguity leading to inconsistencies, which will affect the reliability of the final solution. Accordingly, the Object Management Group (OMG) has proposed the “Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules” (SBVR) standard which offers the opportunity to gather business rules in a natural language format having a formal logic aspect, letting the possibility to be understood by not only the different stakeholders but also directly processed by the machine. Since the SBVR standard is born to represent business rules by combining business vocabulary, it would be wise to give a great attention to the latter. In this paper we present an approach to extract business vocabulary according to SBVR Structured English as one of possibly notation that can map to the SBVR Meta-Model, with a view to provide a relevant resource for the next software deployment steps.|||||||10.1007/978-3-030-11914-0_19|Haj_2018||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Automated Checking of Conformance to SBVR Structured English Notation|Abdellatif Haj, Abdellatif Haj, Youssef Balouki, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadi, Taoufiq Gadi|2018|Business rules are generally captured in a natural language. The inherit ambiguity of the latter is often seen as a cause for project failure, which makes it necessary to translate natural language business rules statements to another language sufficiently formal. However, business experts are generally not familiar with formal languages, which can complicate the communication between stakeholders. For this reason, Object Management Group (OMG) had proposed SBVR Standard (2008) for modeling complex organizations in a natural language but in a formal and detailed way. As a result, several studies have succeeded to increase the accuracy of their approaches by transforming their models from/to SBVR standard. Clearly then, the success of these approaches depends on the quality of the SBVR based statements used or generated. This paper presents an approach for checking conformance of both lexicon and syntax of Business Rules (BR) expressed with Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR), to SBVR Structured English notation (SBVR-SE) using Natural Language Processing (NLP).|||||||10.1007/978-3-030-11928-7_63|Haj_2018b||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Automated Identification of Semantic Similarity between Concepts of Textual Business Rules|Abdellatif Haj, Abdellatif Haj, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadi, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadi|2021|Business Rules (BR) are usually written by different stakeholders, which makes them vulnerable to contain different designations for a same concept. Such problem can be the source of a not well orchestrated behaviors. Whereas identification of synonyms is manual or totally neglected in most approaches dealing with natural language Business Rules. In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify semantic similarity between terms in textual BR using Natural Language Processing and knowledge-based algorithm refined using heuristics. Our method is unique in that it also identifies abbreviations/expansions (as a special case of synonym) which is not possible using a dictionary. Then, results are saved in a standard format (SBVR) for reusability purposes. Our approach was applied on more than 160 BR statements divided on three cases with an accuracy between 69% and 87% which suggests it to be an indispensable enhancement for other methods dealing with textual BR.|||||||10.22266/ijies2021.0228.15|Haj_2021||||International Journal of Intelligent Engineering and Systems|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
The Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules: An Automatic Generation From Textual Statements|Abdellatif Haj, Abdellatif Haj, Abdessamad Jarrar, Abdessamad Jarrar, Abdessamd Jarrar, Youssef Balouki, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadir, Taoufiq Gadir|2021|In the early phases of the software development process, specifications are mostly written in a natural language rather than formal models, which is not supported by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA).

However, businesspeople are usually not familiar with SBVR standard. In this paper we present an approach to automatically transform textual business rules to an SBVR model, to facilitate its integration in nowadays information technology infrastructures. Our approach is distinguished from existing works in that it uses an in-depth Natural Language Processing to extract a more comprehensible SBVR model that includes the semantic formulation of each business rule statement, coupled with a Terminological Dictionary of extracted concepts, to which we have added further specifications such as definitions and synonyms.

Automated generation of terminological dictionary from textual business rules|Abdellatif Haj, Abdellatif Haj, Youssef Balouki, Youssef Balouki, Taoufiq Gadi, Taoufiq Gadi|2021|Abstract To support decision making, organizations tend to operate according to Business Rules, which are usually represented in a natural language format easily understood by all intervenors. According to the business rules manifesto by the Business Rules Group (OMG), rules build on facts, and facts build on concepts as expressed by terms. To avoid ambiguity and misunderstanding, the standardization of the terminology used at the business level becomes a persistent need. However, doing so manually is error prone and time consuming, especially that the Business Rules are the subject of continuous updating. In this paper, we present an automated approach to generate the Business Vocabulary from textual statements of Business Rules. Our approach is distinguished from existing works in that it extracts the Terminological Dictionary as described by the Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard to provide a more comprehensive meaning for each concept. Accordingly, an in‐depth Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to extract not only flat list of terms and relations, but also extra specifications and implicit knowledge. With a satisfactory result, our approach has proved its capability to automatically generate the SBVR Terminological Dictionary from large number of natural language business rules statements.|||||||10.1002/smr.2339|Haj_2021b||||Journal of Software: Evolution and Process|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Fundamental legal conceptions as applied in judicial reasoning|Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld|1917|Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, born in 1879, died prematurely in 1918. He left only a few law journal articles as his published work. His 'Fundamental Legal Conceptions', originally published as two articles in the 'Yale Law Journal' for 1913 and 1917 and left incompletely revised at his death is, however, one of the principal foundations of analytic jurisprudence. The analysis of rights that Hohfeld offers is still regularly cited and relied upon by both lawyers and philosophers, and it is treated as a source of insight into the nature of moral rights as well as the legal rights that were Hohfeld’s own focus of concern. Although some of his analytical distinctions were anticipated by earlier jurists, their insights were fragmentary and imperfect by comparison. Hohfeld’s systematic and exhaustive (yet concise) treatment is generally regarded as unsurpassed. This is not to say that he has not been criticized, but his book forms the essential starting point for any discussion of the nature and structure of rights. 'Fundamental Legal Conceptions' has long been difficult to obtain. This new edition makes this classic of analytic jurisprudence available with a comprehensive introduction by Dr. N.E.

Ranking of text documents using TF-IDF weighting and association rules mining|Siham Jabri, Siham Jabri, Azzeddine Dahbi, Azzeddine Dahbi, Taoufiq Gadi, Taoufiq Gadi, Abdelhak Bassir, Abdelhak Bassir|2018|The amount of information has increased exponentially over the past few years. Most of the text documents are unstructured and not organized and hence user facing more difficult to find his information needs. It creates a challenge for information retrieval for ranking documents according to the user relevance. One of more useful and efficient retrieval model is the vector space model. It uses term weighting tf-idf for assigning a score to a query/document pair, in order to rank the documents. This method is based on the bag-of-words model and does not capture position of terms in document and semantics. Keeping this approach, here we propose a new ranking measure that combines the vector space measure denoted tf-idf and new factor deducted from association rules technique based on dominance relations. This approach will help the user to get the most relevant documents at the beginning. The experiments on TREC collection show that the proposed method is giving better results compared to the baselines and the semantic ranking ESA.|||||||10.1109/icoa.2018.8370597|Jabri_2018||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

LAUREN - Knowledge Graph Summarization for Question Answering|Rricha Jalota, Rricha Jalota, Daniel Vollmers, Daniel Vollmers, Diego Moussallem, Diego Moussallem, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo|2021|Besides the challenge that a human can ask one question in many different ways, a key aspect in Question Answering approaches over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is to deal with the vast amount of information present in the knowledge graphs. Modern real-world knowledge graphs contain nearly millions of entities and relationships. Additionally, they are enriched with new facts every day. However, not all facts are relevant for answering particular questions, thus fostering several challenges to KGQA systems, which require interpretable and query-able data. One solution to filtering the extra data in knowledge graphs is to rely on graph summarization techniques. Graph-based summarization approaches aim to resize knowledge graphs to be more concise and precise by storing only relevant information. In this paper, we propose a framework named LAUREN that applies different summarization techniques on knowledge graphs to be used in KGQA systems. Our experiments show that LAUREN summarizes large knowledge graphs such as DBpedia by 2 million entities and its summarization still achieves the same performance on both question answering and linking tasks compared to the complete DBpedia.|||||||10.1109/icsc50631.2021.00047|Jalota_2021||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

After discussing the PSI directive, it gives an overview of current policies and practices with regard to open government data in the Member States. It is argued that the success of the open government data movement in some Member States can be related to the confusion or ignorance about the relationship between traditional freedom of information legislation and the re-use of public sector data. If future information policies decide to follow this trend, they should always ensure that existing rights on freedom of information are not harmed.|||||||10.1016/j.giq.2011.01.004|Janssen_2011||||Government Information Quarterly|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
A Semantically Rich Framework for Knowledge Representation of Code of Federal Regulations|Karuna Pande Joshi, Karuna Pande Joshi, Srishty Saha|2020|Federal government agencies and organizations doing business with them have to adhere to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The CFRs are currently available as large text documents that are not machine processable and so require extensive manual effort to parse and comprehend, especially when sections cross-reference topics spread across various titles. We have developed a novel framework to automatically extract knowledge from CFRs and represent it using a semantically rich knowledge graph. The framework captures knowledge in the form of key terms, rules, topic summaries, relationships between various terms, semantically similar terminologies, deontic expressions, and cross-referenced facts and rules. We built our framework using deep learning technologies like TensorFlow for word embeddings and text summarization, Gensim for topic modeling, and Semantic Web technologies for building the knowledge graph. In this article, we describe our framework in detail and present the results of our analysis of the Title 48 CFR knowledge base that we have built using this framework. Our framework and knowledge graph can be adopted by federal agencies and businesses to automate their internal processes that reference the CFR rules and policies.|||||||10.1145/3425192|Joshi_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Domain adaptation for an automated classification of deontic modalities in software engineering contracts|Vivek Joshi, Vivek Joshi, Preethu Rose Anish, Smita Ghaisas|2021|Contracts are agreements between parties engaging in economic transactions. They specify deontic modalities that the signatories should be held responsible for and state the penalties or actions to be taken if the stated agreements are not met. Additionally, contracts have also been known to be source of Software Engineering (SE) requirements. Identifying the deontic modalities in contracts can therefore add value to the Requirements Engineering (RE) phase of SE. The complex and ambiguous language of contracts make it difficult and time-consuming to identify the deontic modalities (obligations, permissions, prohibitions), embedded in the text. State-of-art neural network models are effective for text classification; however, they require substantial amounts of training data. The availability of contracts data is sparse owing to the confidentiality concerns of customers. In this paper, we leverage the linguistic and taxonomical similarities between regulations (available abundantly in the public domain) and contracts to demonstrate that it is possible to use regulations as training data for classifying deontic modalities in real-life contracts. We discuss the results of a range of experiments from the use of rule-based approach to Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for automating the classification of deontic modalities. With BERT, we obtained an average precision and recall of 90% and 89.66% respectively.|||||||10.1145/3468264.3473921|Joshi_2021||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Transformation of SBVR compliant business rules to executable FCL rules|Aqueo Kamada, Aqueo Kamada, Guido Governatori, Guido Governatori, Shazia Sadiq, Shazia Sadiq|2010|The main source of changing requirements of the dynamic business environment is response to changes in regulations and contracts towards which businesses are obligated to comply. At the same time, many organizations have their business processes specified independently of their business obligations (which include adherence to contracts laws and regulations). Thus, the problem of mapping business changes into computational systems becomes much more complicated. In this paper we address the problem by providing an automated transformation of business rules into a formal language capable of directly mapping onto executable specifications. The model transformation is consistent with MDA/MOF/QVT concepts using ATL to perform the mapping. Business rules are compliant to SBVR metamodel, and are transformed into FCL, a logic based formalism, known to have a direct mapping onto executable specifications. Both, source and target rules are based on principles of deontic logic, the core of which are obligations, permissions and prohibitions.|||||||10.1007/978-3-642-16289-3_14|Kamada_2010||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

The Need for Business Vocabularies in BPM or ISD Related Activities: Survey Based Study|Kęstutis Kapočius, Kestutis Kapocius, Tomas Skersys, Tomas Skersys, Rimantas Butleris, Rimantas Butleris|2014|Inclusion of business vocabularies (BVs), also referred to as glossaries, into information systems development (ISD) activities is a growing trend, yet this process is often lacking objective feedback and consolidated opinion from the industry and experts. In an effort to fill this gap, the two-stage research study with people working in the fields of information systems development or business process management (BPM) has been carried out. In this paper, key results of the questionnaire-based exploratory survey have been presented. Results make it relatively safe to presume that the BPM/ISD community generally supports the developments in the field of business vocabulary integration and standardization. On the other hand, results reveal that existing standards like SBVR are not widely known, and the BVs themselves are rarely considered a necessary element of the project. These findings could serve as a solid proof that research in this area, as well as development of working solutions, especially CASE tool integrations, should be intensified.|||||||10.1109/cit.2014.111|Kapočius_2014||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Applying MDA to Rule and Data Generation for Compliance Checking|Deepali Kholkar, Deepali Kholkar, Sagar Sunkle, Sagar Sunkle, Vinay Kulkarni, Vinay Kulkarni|2016|Compliance to regulations is a critical problem for enterprises. Increasing regulation and need for reduced time-to-market has led enterprises to look to technology to scale and automate their compliance efforts. Automated compliance checking approaches proposed in research need human experts to formally encode rules, as well as to extract the relevant data from enterprise data stores. We present a model-driven architecture (MDA) and method to semi-automate generation of formal rules and extraction of relevant data for compliance checking, based on OMG’s MDA methodology. We demonstrate how building a fact-oriented model of the regulation is central to both relating it to the enterprise as well as deriving formal specification of rules. We illustrate our approach using a real-life case study of the MiFID-2 financial regulation.|||||||10.1007/978-3-319-62569-0_12|Kholkar_2016||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Visual Modeling of Business Process Compliance Rules with the Support of Multiple Perspectives|David Knuplesch, David Knuplesch, Manfred Reichert, Manfred Reichert, Linh Thao Ly, Linh Thao Ly, Akhil Kumar, Akhil Kumar, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma|2013|A fundamental challenge for any process-aware information system is to ensure compliance of modeled and executed business processes with imposed compliance rules stemming from guidelines, standards and laws. Such compliance rules usually refer to multiple process perspectives including control flow, time, resources, data, and interactions with business partners. On one hand, compliance rules should be comprehensible for domain experts who must define and apply them. On the other, they should have a precise semantics such that they can be automatically processed. In this context, providing a visual compliance rule language seems promising as it allows hiding formal details and offers an intuitive way of modeling. So far, visual compliance rule languages have focused on the control flow perspective, but lack adequate support for the other perspectives. To remedy this drawback, this paper provides an approach that extends visual compliance rule languages with the ability to consider data, time, resources, and partner interactions when modeling business process compliance rules. Overall, this extension will foster business process compliance support in practice.|||||||10.1007/978-3-642-41924-9_10|Knuplesch_2013||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
ContractNLI: A Dataset for Document-level Natural Language Inference for Contracts.|Yuta Koreeda, Yuta Koreeda, Christopher D. Manning, Christopher D. Manning|2021|"Reviewing contracts is a time-consuming procedure that incurs large expenses to companies and social inequality to those who cannot afford it. In this work, we propose ""document-level natural language inference (NLI) for contracts"", a novel, real-world application of NLI that addresses such problems. In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses (such as ""Some obligations of Agreement may survive termination."") and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is ""entailed by"", ""contradicting to"" or ""not mentioned by"" (neutral to) the contract as well as identifying ""evidence"" for the decision as spans in the contract. We annotated and release the largest corpus to date consisting of 607 annotated contracts. We then show that existing models fail badly on our task and introduce a strong baseline, which (1) models evidence identification as multi-label classification over spans instead of trying to predict start and end tokens, and (2) employs more sophisticated context segmentation for dealing with long documents. We also show that linguistic characteristics of contracts, such as negations by exceptions, are contributing to the difficulty of this task and that there is much room for improvement."|||||||null|Koreeda_2021||||arXiv: Computation and Language|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

This holds also for the legal domain where several ontologies have been put forward to model specific kinds of legal knowledge.

To answer this need, in this paper, we address an analysis of the state-of-the-art in legal ontologies and we characterise them along with some distinctive features. This paper aims to guide generic users and law experts in selecting the legal ontology that better fits their needs and in understanding its specificity so that proper extensions to the selected model could be investigated.|||||||10.1007/s10506-019-09252-1|Leone_2019||||Artificial Intelligence and Law|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Monitoring business process compliance using compliance rule graphs|Linh Thao Ly, Linh Thao Ly, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, David Knuplesch, David Knuplesch, Peter Dadam, Peter Dadam|2011|Driven by recent trends, effective compliance control has become a crucial success factor for companies nowadays. In this context, compliance monitoring is considered an important building block to support business process compliance. Key to the practical application of a monitoring framework will be its ability to reveal and pinpoint violations of imposed compliance rules that occur during process execution. In this context, we propose a compliance monitoring framework that tackles three major challenges. As a compliance rule can become activated multiple times within a process execution, monitoring only its overall enforcement can be insufficient to assess and deal with compliance violations. Therefore, our approach enables to monitor each activation of a compliance rule individually. In case of violations, we are able to derive the particular root cause, which is helpful to apply specific remedy strategies. Even if a rule activation is not yet violated, the framework can provide assistance in proactively enforcing compliance by deriving measures to render the rule activation satisfied.|||||||10.1007/978-3-642-25109-2_7|Ly_2011||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Recently, many approaches have been proposed that utilize a broad range of constraint languages and techniques to realize compliance monitoring solutions. Due to this diversity, the comparison of existing approaches is difficult and consequently hampers the evaluation of which approaches are suitable for which application scenarios. This paper provides a framework to compare and evaluate existing compliance monitoring approaches. The framework is based on ten typical Compliance Monitoring Functionalities (CMFs). These have been derived using a systematic literature review and five case studies from different domains.

Transforming BPMN 2.0 Business Process Model into SBVR Business Vocabulary and Rules|Eglė Mickevičiūtė, Egle Mickeviciute, Rimantas Butleris, Rimantas Butleris, Saulius Gudas, Saulius Gudas, Saulius Gudas, Eimutis Karčiauskas, Eimutis Karčiauskas|2017|As the success of information system projects and their development also relies on the knowledge of domain experts, the modelled processes should be presented to them for validation purposes before the implementation stage. Domain experts do not have the knowledge of business process modelling notations. Therefore, the validation may not be correct. However, they better understand structured natural language, such as SBVR that defines the meaning of business concepts and make them unambiguously understandable by human experts and also by software systems. The solution presented in this paper allows transforming BPMN 2.0 business process models into SBVR business vocabularies and business rules. This solution is implemented as a plug-in and is available in the MagicDraw CASE tool. An experimental evaluation of the proposed solution with three domain areas proved that SBVR business vocabulary and business rules could be fully obtained from BPMN 2.0 business process model when certain requirements for BPMN 2.0 business process model are met. The advantages of the solution are an automatic transformation for various BPMN modelling situations, tracing links between two models in one modelling environment and avoidance of necessity to use linguistic techniques.

MatGap: A Systematic Approach to Perform Match and Gap Analysis among SBVR-Based Domain Specific Business Rules|Sayandeep Mitra, Sayandeep Mitra, Chandan Prakash, Chandan Prakash, Sanjay Chakraborty, Shayak Chakraborty, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli|2018|In the modern age, the need for automation has led to Business Organizations representing their functionality as structured Business Rules. SBVR has come up as an universally popular format for representation of Business Rules. The presence of different Business Organizations working in a particular real life domain results in generation of different rules for each of the organization. Due to the varying business practices, like mergers & acquisitions, upgrades, incorporation of a new application, etc., it becomes necessary to compare a set of Business Rules of a particular organization with the rules of a reference model, to get a measure of similarity among the business functionality of the two. Presently, this comparison is carried out manually by business experts or by executing the rules of one organization with the data of another and checking if they are compliant. Both the approaches are extremely tedious and expensive as modern organizations have huge rule sets and data sets.We present MatGap, a tool which performs a systematic Match and Gap Analysis between two sets of SBVR-based Business Rules applicable to a specific domain, using Global Vectors(GloVe) model and SMT-LIBv2. The analysis report gives a measure of Match among the rules and entities, thus providing the best alignment and aids to identify the representational Gaps(if any) among the rules and entities. The tool also checks whether the embedded logic in the reference Business Rule set is covered by the other Rule set, thus highlighting the business functionality gap that is present in the latter.|||||||10.1109/apsec.2018.00070|Mitra_2018a||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Analyzing Business Systems comprised of Rules and Processes using Decision Diagrams|Sayandeep Mitra, Sayandeep Mitra, Sayandeep Mitra, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Ansuman Banerjee, Ansuman Banerjee|2020|Modern Businesses are rapidly growing in complexity and functionalities. To ensure smooth functioning, businesses need to adhere to a set of guidelines and constraints which are efficiently represented by Business Rules(BRs). Due to the large number of inter-dependent BRs, anomalies such as inconsistencies, redundancies and circularities creep in to the rule base, which if not dealt with properly can cause the business to function improperly causing significant damage at multiple levels. Present state of the art methods identify such anomalies in BRs by converting the rules to knowledge representation (Ontology, SMT-LIBv2, etc.) and then running them on solvers. These approaches suffer from certain drawbacks, namely incomplete mappings and scalability of solvers. To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper we propose to represent the Business Rules(BRs) as Decision Diagrams (BDD, SDD, MDD, etc.) and use graph algorithms on top of their canonical representations to identify anomalies. Presently, business rules and processes are treated separately. We model rules as Decision Diagrams(DDs) to integrate with certain graphical representations of business processes (e.g., DCR Graphs, BPMN, etc.), enabling us to efficiently analyze a much more enriched set of business information. We show an initial set of mappings from business rules to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's), integrate with processes, identify various anomalies and outline our vision and prospective reach of this approach.|||||||10.1145/3385032.3385051|Mitra_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Entity Linking meets Word Sense Disambiguation: A Unified Approach|Andrea Moro, Andrea Moro, Alessandro Raganato, Alessandro Raganato, Roberto Navigli, Roberto Navigli|2014|Entity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) both address the lexical ambiguity of language. But while the two tasks are pretty similar, they differ in a fundamental respect: in EL the textual mention can be linked to a named entity which may or may not contain the exact mention, while in WSD there is a perfect match between the word form (better, its lemma) and a suitable word sense. In this paper we present Babelfy, a unified graph-based approach to EL and WSD based on a loose identification of candidate meanings coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic which selects high-coherence semantic interpretations. Our experiments show state-of- the-art performances on both tasks on 6 different datasets, including a multilingual setting.

Open Information Extraction Using Dependency Parser for Business Rule Mining in SBVR Format|Chandan Prakash, Chandan Prakash, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Pavan Kumar Chittimalli, Ravindra Naik, Ravindra Naik|2021|Business Rules exists at the core of any Business Organization. For efficient execution of the business system, all the business rules must be in machine-interpretable format.

BRMiner is based on the idea of Open Information Extraction (OIE). We have shown that existing OIE systems are not suitable for SBVR rule formation that leads to the development of a new OIE system BRMiner, with more accurate prediction and additional capabilities. BRMiner uses the state of the art dependency parser to convert an unstructured business rule to the corresponding structured format.

Legal ontologies over time: A systematic mapping study|Cleyton Mário Oliveira Rodrigues, Cleyton Mario Oliveira Rodrigues, Frederico Luiz Gonçalves Freitas, Emanoel Barreiros, Ryan Ribeiro Azevedo, Adauto Trigueiro Almeida Filho|2019|Abstract Over the last 30 years, AI & Law has provided breakthroughs in studies involving case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning, information retrieval and, most recently, conceptual models for knowledge representation and reasoning, known as Legal Ontologies. Ontologies have been widely used by legal practitioners, scholars, and lay people in a variety of situations, such as simulating legal actions, semantic search and indexing, and to keep up-to-date with the continual change of laws and regulations. Given the high number of legal ontologies produced, the need to summarize this research realm through a well-defined methodological procedure is urgent need. This study presents the results of a systematic mapping of the literature, aiming at categorizing legal ontologies along certain dimensions, such as purpose, level of generality, underlying legal theories, among other aspects. The reasons to carry out a systematic mapping are twofold: in addition to explaining the maturation of the area over recent decades, it helps to avoid the old problem of reinventing the wheel. Through organizing and classifying what has already been produced, it is possible to realize that the development of legal ontologies can rise to the level of reusability where prefabricated models might be coupled with new and more complex ontologies for practical law.|||||||10.1016/j.eswa.2019.04.009|Rodrigues_2019||||Expert Systems With Applications|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
NIFify: Towards Better Quality Entity Linking Datasets|Henry Rosales-Méndez, Henry Rosales-Méndez, Henry Rosales-Méndez, Aidan Hogan, Aidan Hogan, Bárbara Poblete, Barbara Poblete|2019|The Entity Linking (EL) task identifies entity mentions in a text corpus and associates them with a corresponding unambiguous entry in a Knowledge Base. The evaluation of EL systems relies on the comparison of their results against gold standards. A common format used to represent gold standard datasets is the NLP Interchange Format (NIF), which uses RDF as a data model. However, creating gold standard datasets for EL is a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this paper we propose a tool called NIFify to help manually generate, curate, visualize and validate EL annotations; the resulting tool is useful, for example, in the creation of gold standard datasets. NIFify also serves as a benchmark tool that enables the assessment of EL results. Using the validation features of NIFify, we further explore the quality of popular EL gold standards.|||||||10.1145/3308560.3316465|Rosales-Méndez_2019||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Analyzing Document Intensive Business Processes using Ontology|Suman Roychoudhury, Suman Roychoudhury, Vinay Kulkarni, Vinay Kulkarni, Nikhil Bellarykar, Nikhil Bellarykar|2015|Knowledge is manifested in an enterprise in various forms ranging from unstructured operational data, to structured information like programs, as well as relational data stored in databases to semi-structured information stored in XML files. This information embodies the core of an enterprise knowledge base and analyzing the knowledge base can result in intelligent decision making. In order to realize this goal we begin with representing and analyzing unstructured knowledge present in an enterprise. In particular, this paper presents a real life example of a document intensive business process (International Trade) and attempts to model and analyze the process in a formal way. Typically, the information contained in a document intensive business process is of operational nature and requires extensive manual verification, which is both time consuming and error prone. Therefore, this research aims to eliminate such exhaustive manual verification by constructing a knowledge base in the form of ontology and apply suitable rule based reasoners to automate the verification process.|||||||10.1145/2806416.2806638|Roychoudhury_2015||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
A NLP Based Framework to Support Document Verification-as-a-Service|Suman Roychoudhury, Suman Roychoudhury, Nikhil Bellarykar, Nikhil Bellarykar, Vinay Kulkarni, Vinay Kulkarni|2016|Many enterprise systems are document intensive that requires extensive manual verification in the form of maker and checker. However, a maker-checker based verification raises several challenges with respect to increase in cost and time of verification. Furthermore, any manual labor intensive verification is not free from human oversight and can lead to costly errors. Therefore, to alleviate the challenges arising out of human verification of document intensive systems, we propose a rule based framework that enables automatic verification of document based systems. The framework uses ontology based knowledge representation techniques along with appropriate natural language processing methods to extract operational rules from business documents and then use suitable reasoning engine for verification. The above framework is validated in the light of a real life case study namely International Trade that deals with several critical financial documents like Letter-of-Credit, Bill-of-Lading, Commercial Invoice etc.|||||||10.1109/edoc.2016.7579376|Roychoudhury_2016||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

We demonstrate transformation of regulations present in legal natural language text (English) to a model form via authoring of Structured English rules in the context of MMSR regulations for a large European bank. This generated regulatory model is eventually translated to formal logic that enables formal compliance checking contrary to current industry practice, that provides content management-based, document-driven and expert-dependent ways of managing regulatory compliance.|||||||10.1007/978-3-030-02302-7_18|Roychoudhury_2018||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
The Role of Common-Sense Knowledge in Assessing Semantic Association|Alice Ruggeri, Alice Ruggeri, Luigi Di, Luigi Di Caro, Guido Boella, Guido Boella|2019|Natural language processing techniques often aim at automatically extracting semantics from texts. However, they usually need some available semantic knowledge contained in dictionaries and resources such as WordNet, Wikipedia, and FrameNet. In this respect, there is a large literature about the creation of novel semantic resources as well as attempts to integrate existing ones. In this context, we here focus on common-sense knowledge, which shows to have interesting characteristics as well as challenging issues such as ambiguity, vagueness, and inconsistency. In this paper, we make use of a large-scale and crowdsourced common-sense knowledge base, i.e., ConceptNet, to qualitatively evaluate its role in the perception of semantic association among words. We then propose an unsupervised method to disambiguate and integrate ConceptNet instances into WordNet, demonstrating how the enriched resource improves the recognition of semantic association. Finally, we describe a novel approach to label semantically associated words by exploiting the functional and behavioral information usually contained in common sense, demonstrating how this enhances the explanation (and the use) of relatedness and similarity with non-numeric information.|||||||10.1007/s13740-018-0094-2|Ruggeri_2019||||Journal on Data Semantics|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

SensEmBERT: Context-Enhanced Sense Embeddings for Multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation|Bianca Scarlini, Bianca Scarlini, Tommaso Pasini, Tommaso Pasini, Roberto Navigli, Roberto Navigli|2020|Contextual representations of words derived by neural language models have proven to effectively encode the subtle distinctions that might occur between different meanings of the same word. However, these representations are not tied to a semantic network, hence they leave the word meanings implicit and thereby neglect the information that can be derived from the knowledge base itself. In this paper, we propose SensEmBERT, a knowledge-based approach that brings together the expressive power of language modelling and the vast amount of knowledge contained in a semantic network to produce high-quality latent semantic representations of word meanings in multiple languages. Our vectors lie in a space comparable with that of contextualized word embeddings, thus allowing a word occurrence to be easily linked to its meaning by applying a simple nearest neighbour approach.We show that, whilst not relying on manual semantic annotations, SensEmBERT is able to either achieve or surpass state-of-the-art results attained by most of the supervised neural approaches on the English Word Sense Disambiguation task. When scaling to other languages, our representations prove to be equally effective as their English counterpart and outperform the existing state of the art on all the Word Sense Disambiguation multilingual datasets. The embeddings are released in five different languages at http://sensembert.org.|||||||null|Scarlini_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Formalising natural language specifications using a cognitive linguistic/configuration based approach|Matt Selway, Matt Selway, Georg Großmann, Georg Grossmann, Wolfgang Mayer, Wolfgang Mayer, Markus Stumptner, Markus Stumptner|2015|This paper addresses the problem of transforming business specifications written in natural language into formal models suitable for use in information systems development. It proposes a method for transforming controlled natural language specifications based on the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules standard. This approach is unique in combining techniques from Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Cognitive Linguistics, and Knowledge-based Configuration, which allows the reliable semantic processing of specifications and integration with existing MDE tools to improve productivity, quality, and time-to-market in software development. The method first learns the vocabulary of the specification from glossary-like definitions then parses the rules of the specification and outputs the resulting formal SBVR model. Both aspects of the method are tested separately, with the system correctly learning 98% of the vocabulary and correctly interpreting 98% of the rules of an SBVR SE based example. Finally, the proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art approaches for creating formal models from natural language specifications, arguing that it meets the criteria necessary to fulfil the three goals of (1) shifting control of specification to non-technical business experts, (2) reducing the manual effort involved in formalising specifications, and (3) supporting business experts in creating well-formed sets of business vocabularies and rules. HighlightsA method for deep processing of natural language business specifications is proposed.The method is based on Cognitive Linguistics and Knowledge-based Configuration.The method acquires vocabulary from a business glossary and parses business rules.The vocabulary acquisition achieves an accuracy of 96%.The semantic analysis of rules achieves an accuracy of 98%.|||||||10.1016/j.is.2015.04.003|Selway_2015||||Information Systems|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
A Benchmark to Understand the Role of Knowledge Graphs on Large Language Model's Accuracy for Question Answering on Enterprise SQL Databases|Juan F. Sequeda, Dean Allemang, Bryon Jacob|2023|Enterprise applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for question answering on enterprise SQL databases. However, the extent to which LLMs can accurately respond to enterprise questions in such databases remains unclear, given the absence of suitable Text-to-SQL benchmarks tailored to enterprise settings. Additionally, the potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance LLM-based question answering by providing business context is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-powered question answering systems in the context of enterprise questions and SQL databases, while also exploring the role of knowledge graphs in improving accuracy. To achieve this, we introduce a benchmark comprising an enterprise SQL schema in the insurance domain, a range of enterprise queries encompassing reporting to metrics, and a contextual layer incorporating an ontology and mappings that define a knowledge graph. Our primary finding reveals that question answering using GPT-4, with zero-shot prompts directly on SQL databases, achieves an accuracy of 16%. Notably, this accuracy increases to 54% when questions are posed over a Knowledge Graph representation of the enterprise SQL database. Therefore, investing in Knowledge Graph provides higher accuracy for LLM powered question answering systems.|||||||10.48550/arxiv.2311.07509|Sequeda_2023||||arXiv.org|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Symboleo: Towards a Specification Language for Legal Contracts|Sepehr Sharifi, Sepehr Sharifi, Daniel Amyot, Alireza Parvizimosaed, Alireza Parvizimosaed, Daniel Amyot, Daniel Amyot, Daniel Amyot, Luigi Logrippo, Luigi Logrippo, John Mylopoulos, John Mylopoulos|2020|Legal contracts specify the terms and conditions (in essence, requirements) that apply to business transactions. Smart contracts are software systems that monitor and control the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. This paper proposes a formal specification language for contracts, called Symboleo, where contracts consist of collections of obligations and powers that define the legal contract’s compliant executions. The formal semantics of Symboleo is based on an extension of an ontology for Law and is described in terms of logical axioms on statecharts that describe the lifetimes of contracts, obligations and powers. Our proposal includes a preliminary evaluation through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract, with a prototype execution engine. We envision this language to enable formally verifying contracts to detect requirements-level issues and to generate executable smart contracts (e.g., on blockchain technology).|||||||10.1109/re48521.2020.00049|Sharifi_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Integrating Personalized PageRank into Neural Word Sense Disambiguation|Ahmed El Sheikh, Ahmed El Sheikh, Michele Bevilacqua, Michele Bevilacqua, Roberto Navigli, Roberto Navigli|2021|Neural Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has recently been shown to benefit from the incorporation of pre-existing knowledge, such as that coming from the WordNet graph. However, state-of-the-art approaches have been successful in exploiting only the local structure of the graph, with only close neighbors of a given synset influencing the prediction. In this work, we improve a classification model by recomputing logits as a function of both the vanilla independently produced logits and the global WordNet graph. We achieve this by incorporating an online neural approximated PageRank, which enables us to refine edge weights as well. This method exploits the global graph structure while keeping space requirements linear in the number of edges. We obtain strong improvements, matching the current state of the art.

Extracting SBVR Business Vocabularies from UML Use Case Models Using M2M Transformations Based on Drag-and-Drop Actions|Tomas Skersys, Tomas Skersys, Paulius Danènas, Paulius Danenas, Rimantas Butleris, Rimantas Butleris, Armantas Ostreika, Armantas Ostreika, Jonas Čeponis, Jonas Ceponis|2021|In the domain of model-driven system engineering, model-to-model (M2M) transformations present a very relevant topic because they may provide much-needed automation capabilities to the whole CASE-supported system development life cycle. Nonetheless, it is observed that throughout the whole development process M2M transformations are spread unevenly; in this respect, the phases of Business Modeling and System Analysis are arguably the most underdeveloped ones. The main novelty and contributions of this paper are the presented set of model-based transformations for extracting well-structured SBVR business vocabularies from visual UML use case models, which utilizes M2M transformation technology based on the so-called drag-and-drop actions. The conducted experiments show that this new development provides the same transformation power while introducing more flexibility to the model development process as compared to our previously developed approach for (semi-)automatic extraction of SBVR business vocabularies from UML use case models.|||||||10.3390/app11146464|Skersys_2021||||Applied Sciences|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Transforming BPMN Processes to SBVR Process Rules with Deontic Modalities|Tomas Skersys, Tomas Skersys, Paulius Danenas, Paulius Danènas, Egle Mickeviciute, Eglė Mickevičiūtė, Rimantas Butleris, Rimantas Butleris|2022|The Object Management Group (OMG) has put considerable effort into the standardization of various business modeling aspects within the context of model-driven systems development. Indeed, the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is now arguably the most popular process modeling language. At the same time, the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR), which is a novel and formally sound standard for the specification of virtually any kind of knowledge using controlled natural language, is also gaining its grounds. Nonetheless, the integration between these two very much related standards remains weak. In this paper, we present one such integration effort, namely an approach for the extraction of SBVR process rules from BPMN processes. To accomplish this, we utilized model-to-model transformation technology, which is one of the core features of Model-Driven Architecture. At the core of the presented solution stands a set of model transformation rules and two algorithms specifying the formation of formally defined process rules from process models. Basic implementation aspects, together with the source code of the solution, are also presented in the paper. The experimental results acquired from the automatic model transformation have shown full compliance with the benchmark results and cover the entirety of the specified flow of work defined in the experimental process models. Following this, it is safe to conclude that the set of specified transformation rules and algorithms was sufficient for the given scope of the experiment, providing a solid background for the practical application and future developments of the solution.|||||||10.3390/app12188976|Skersys_2022||||Applied sciences|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Data-driven Improvement of Online Conformance Checking|Florian Stertz, Florian Stertz, Juergen Mangler, Juergen Mangler, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma|2020|Conformance checking takes a process model and a process log as input and quantifies the degree of conformance between both. This allows a comparison between the intended behavior represented by the model and the actual behavior captured by the log and is useful for many applications such as auditing. Existing approaches calculate conformance as follows: each deviation between model and log is corrected by an alignment, e.g., inserting a missing event to the log, that has a standard per-deviation cost of 1. While deviations in the model can be handled this way, there is no way to differentiate between intended (e.g., ad-hoc repair of instances) and unintended (e.g., security breaches) deviations. Hence this work proposes an advanced cost function, that allows for per-deviation adjustments of the per-deviation costs. By inspecting how the data elements of subsequent tasks are affected, it becomes possible to automatically increase or decrease the per-deviation costs of 1, thus allowing for an automatic classification of deviation causes. The proposed approach works offline and online (i.e., at runtime) and is evaluated based on a real-world dataset from the manufacturing domain.|||||||10.1109/edoc49727.2020.00031|Stertz_2020||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib
NLP Based Retrieval of Semantically Similar Private Tax Rulings|Tomasz Strąk, Michał Tuszyński|2022|We report preliminary findings of the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for retrieving semantically similar private tax rulings (PTRs). The PTR corpus contains now more than 400 thousands of PTRs and was first described quantitively in [17]. Experiments show that use of BERT-based embeddings and cosine similarity results in very high quality set of legally similar PTRs. The quality of the set is at least on par with a manual search performed by a certified tax advisor. We also show that similar PTRs form high quality clusters that can be used for investigation of fine structure of the set. The results presented in the paper, although preliminary, already have significant practical value for tax practitioners.|||||||10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.343|Strąk_2022||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

This work describes a general framework for the development of a system to identify and classify implicit inter-relationships between parts of a legal text. In particular, our approach demonstrates the usefulness of co-occurrence networks of terms, in a practical experimental setting based on an EU Regulation. First, a manual annotation task identify instances of different kinds of implicit links in the norm. In addition to a typical NLP pipeline, our framework includes a technique from Information Architecture, i.e. card sorting. Second, we construct co-occurrence networks of the law terms to derive graph metrics. Third, binary classification experiments identify the existence (and the type) of inter-relationships by using a Bag-of-Ngrams model integrated with network analysis features. The results demonstrate how the adoption of co-occurrence network features improves the identification of links, for all the classifiers here considered. This is encouraging toward a wider adoption of this kind of network analysis technique in legal informatics.|||||||10.1016/j.is.2021.101821|Sulis_2021||||Information Systems|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

In European law, a relevant interest relates to the transposition of EU directives by the Member States, which can be complete, partial, or eventually absent. As part of an European project, legal experts annotated transpositions of six directives on a per-article basis. Following an established NLP pipeline, we explore a similarity-based technique to identify correspondences between transpositions of national implementations.

Explanation of Proofs of Regulatory (Non-)Compliance Using Semantic Vocabularies|Sagar Sunkle, Sagar Sunkle, Deepali Kholkar, Deepali Kholkar, Vinay Kulkarni, Vinay Kulkarni|2015|With recent regulatory advances, modern enterprises have to not only comply with regulations but have to be prepared to provide explanation of proof of (non-)compliance. On top of compliance checking, this necessitates modeling concepts from regulations and enterprise operations so that stakeholder-specific and close to natural language explanations could be generated. We take a step in this direction by using Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules to model and map vocabularies of regulations and operations of enterprise. Using these vocabularies and leveraging proof generation abilities of an existing compliance engine, we show how such explanations can be created. Basic natural language explanations that we generate can be easily enriched by adding requisite domain knowledge to the vocabularies.|||||||10.1007/978-3-319-21542-6_25|Sunkle_2015||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

Solving Semantic Disparity and Explanation Problems in Regulatory Compliance- A Research-In-Progress Report with Design Science Research Perspective|Sagar Sunkle, Sagar Sunkle, Deepali Kholkar, Deepali Kholkar, Vinay Kulkarni, Vinay Kulkarni|2015|Modern enterprises increasingly face the challenge of keeping pace with regulatory compliances. Semantic disparity between regulation texts, their interpretations, and operational specifics of enterprise often leads enterprises to situations where it becomes difficult for them to establish what compliance means, how they are supposed to affect it in the operational practices, and how to prove that they comply when asked for explanations of (non-)compliance. We take a step toward reducing the semantic disparity by using semantic vocabularies to map regulations with available operational details of enterprise and utilize them in enacting compliance. We also propose to provide explanations of proofs of (non-)compliance. We report our ongoing work in this regard using the design science research (DSR) paradigm. Initial iterations of design cycle from DSR have been useful to us in identifying and matching stakeholder-specific goals in solving these problems.|||||||10.1007/978-3-319-19237-6_21|Sunkle_2015e||||null|||||||article|||dissertacao-2024.bib

We present a semi-automated treatment of regulatory texts by automating in unison, the key steps in fact-orientation and relation extraction. In addition, we utilize the domain models in learning to identify rules from the text. The key benefit of our approach is that it can be applied to any legal text with a considerably reduced burden on domain experts.

Named Entity Recognition for Entity Linking: What Works and What’s Next|Simone Tedeschi, Simone Tedeschi, Simone Conia, Simone Conia, Francesco Cecconi, Francesco Cecconi, Roberto Navigli, Roberto Navigli|2021|Entity Linking (EL) systems have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks mainly thanks to the contextualized representations provided by recent pretrained language models.

Since regulatory documents and processes are subject to frequent change, the constant comparison between both is mandatory. Additionally, new regulations must be integrated and checked against existing process models. To address these challenges, we provide an approach that uses natural language processing to automatically support compliance assessment between regulatory documents and process model repositories. The outcome is a pairwise matching between parts of a regulatory document and process models from a repository. This matching can be used to either determine the coverage of regulations by a process model or to guide compliance assessment by ranking models based on their fitness and cost.

To this end, we propose a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR), which couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph. Our contributions include four aspects. We first highlight the significance of incorporating knowledge graphs into recommendation to formally define and interpret the reasoning process. Second, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach featuring an innovative soft reward strategy, user-conditional action pruning and a multi-hop scoring function.

Reinforcement Learning Over Knowledge Graphs for Explainable Dialogue Intent Mining|Kai Yang, Kai Yang, Xinyu Kong, Xinyu Kong, Yafang Wang, Yafang Wang, Jie Zhang, Jie Zhang, Jie Zhang, Gerard Melo, Gerard Melo, Gerard Melo|2020|In light of the millions of households that have adopted intelligent assistant powered devices, multi-turn dialogue has become an important field of inquiry. Most current methods identify the underlying intent in the dialogue using opaque classification techniques that fail to provide any interpretable basis for the classification. To address this, we propose a scheme to interpret the intent in multi-turn dialogue based on specific characteristics of the dialogue text. We rely on policy-guided reinforcement learning to identify paths in a graph to confirm concrete paths of inference that serve as interpretable explanations. The graph is induced based on the multi-turn dialogue user utterances, the intents, i.e., standard queries of the dialogues, and the sub-intents associated with the dialogues. Our reinforcement learning method then discerns the characteristics of the dialogue in chronological order as the basis for multi-turn dialogue path selection.

This validation in context is a key feature of the book - since an artifact is designed for a context, it should also be validated in this context. The book is divided into five parts. Part I discusses the fundamental nature of design science and its artifacts, as well as related design research questions and goals. Part II deals with the design cycle, i.e. the creation, design and validation of artifacts based on requirements and stakeholder goals. To elaborate this further, Part III presents the role of conceptual frameworks and theories in design science. Part IV continues with the empirical cycle to investigate artifacts in context, and presents the different elements of research problem analysis, research setup and data analysis. Finally, Part V deals with the practical application of the empirical cycle by presenting in detail various research methods, including observational case studies, case-based and sample-based experiments and technical action research. These main sections are complemented by two generic checklists, one for the design cycle and one for the empirical cycle. The book is written for students as well as academic and industrial researchers in software engineering or information systems. It provides guidelines on how to effectively structure research goals, how to analyze research problems concerning design goals and knowledge questions, how to validate artifact designs and how to empirically investigate artifacts in context and finally how to present the results of the design cycle as a whole.||||||||wieringa2014design|||||||||Springer||book|||dissertacao-2024.bib
On rule extraction from regulations|Adam Wyner, Wim Peters|2011|Rules in regulations such as found in the US Federal Code of Regulations can be expressed using conditional and deontic rules. Identifying and extracting such rules from the language of the source material would be useful for automating rulebook management and translating into an executable logic. The paper presents a linguistically-oriented, rule-based approach, which is in contrast to a machine learning approach. It outlines use cases, discusses the source materials, reviews the methodology, then provides initial results and future steps.|113--122|||||Legal knowledge and information systems||wyner2011rule|||||||||IOS Press||incollection|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Towards an ontology network in finance and economics|Glenda Amaral, Tiago Prince Sales, Giancarlo Guizzardi|2021|Finance and economics are wide domains, where ontologies are useful instruments for dealing with semantic interoperability and information integration problems, as well as improving communication and problem solving among people. In particular, reference ontologies have been widely recognized as powerful tools for representing a model of consensus within a community to support communication, meaning negotiation, consensus establishment, as well as semantic interoperability and information integration. In domains like economics and finance, which are too large and complex to be represented as a single, large and monolithic ontology, it is necessary to create an ontological framework, built incrementally and in an integrated way, as a network. Therefore, in this paper we introduce OntoFINE, an Ontology Network in Finance and Economics that organizes and integrates knowledge in the realm on finance and economics, serving as a basis to several applications. We discuss the development of OntoFINE and present some of its applications.|42--57|||||Enterprise Engineering Working Conference||amaral2021towards|||||||||||inproceedings|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Developing SBVR vocabularies and business rules from OWL2 ontologies|Gintare Bernotaityte, Lina Nemuraite, Rita Butkiene, Bronius Paradauskas|2013|Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) is OMG adopted metamodel allowing defining noun concepts, verb concepts and business rules of a problem domain in structured natural language based on formal logics. SBVR business vocabulary and business rules are capable of representing ontologies. There are some research works devoted to transforming SBVR into Web Ontology Language OWL2. The reverse way of representing ontology concepts with SBVR structured language was not investigated though there are much more ontologies than SBVR vocabularies. Our research is concentrated on methodology for creating SBVR vocabularies and rules from OWL2 ontologies without a loss of the expressive power, characteristic for ontologies, as some ontology-specific concepts have no direct representation in SBVR. The particular attention is devoted to applying SBVR vocabulary in semantic search.|134--145|||||Information and Software Technologies: 19th International Conference, ICIST 2013, Kaunas, Lithuania, October 2013.

Combining natural language processing approaches for rule extraction from legal documents|Mauro Dragoni, Serena Villata, Williams Rizzi, Guido Governatori|2018|Legal texts express conditions in natural language describing what is permitted, forbidden or mandatory in the context they regulate. Despite the numerous approaches tackling the problem of moving from a natural language legal text to the respective set of machine-readable conditions, results are still unsatisfiable and it remains a major open challenge. In this paper, we propose a preliminary approach which combines different Natural Language Processing techniques towards the extraction of rules from legal documents. More precisely, we combine the linguistic information provided by WordNet together with a syntax-based extraction of rules from legal texts, and a logic-based extraction of dependencies between chunks of such texts. Such a combined approach leads to a powerful solution towards the extraction of machine-readable rules from legal documents. We evaluate the proposed approach over the Australian “Telecommunications consumer protections code”.|287--300|||||AI Approaches to the Complexity of Legal Systems: AICOL International Workshops 2015-2017: AICOL-VI@ JURIX 2015, AICOL-VII@ EKAW 2016, AICOL-VIII@ JURIX 2016, AICOL-IX@ ICAIL 2017, and AICOL-X@ JURIX 2017, Revised Selected Papers 6||dragoni2018combining|||||||||||inproceedings|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Towards a framework for semantically-enabled compliance management in financial services|Amal Elgammal, Tom Butler|2015|Following the crisis in 2008, the financial industry has faced growing numbers of laws and regulations globally. The number and complexity of these regulations is creating significant issues for governance, risk and compliance management in almost all industrial sectors; however some of these sectors are characterized by being heavily-regulated including the financial industry. This paper proposes a semantically-enabled compliance management framework. In the heart of the framework is an integrated semantic repository incorporating regulatory, business and compliance knowledge; i.e., CMKB. The approach is underpinned by legal Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) interpreting financial regulations and encoding them in the Semantics of Business vocabulary and Business Rule (SBVR) standard. As a proof-of-concept, we have integrated the SBVR and CMKB repositories with a validated compliance solution for design-time compliance verification. However, the approach could be integrated with other compliance solutions at different phases of the business process lifecycle.|171--184|||||Service-Oriented Computing-ICSOC 2014 Workshops: WESOA; SeMaPS, RMSOC, KASA, ISC, FOR-MOVES, CCSA and Satellite Events, Paris, France, November 3-6, 2014, Revised Selected Papers||elgammal2015towards|||||||||||inproceedings|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Polysemy in controlled natural language texts|Normunds Gruzitis, Guntis Barzdins|2009|Computational semantics and logic-based controlled natural languages (CNL) do not address systematically the word sense disambiguation problem of content words, i.e., they tend to interpret only some functional words that are crucial for construction of discourse representation structures. We show that micro-ontologies and multi-word units allow integration of the rich and polysemous multi-domain background knowledge into CNL thus providing interpretation for the content words. The proposed approach is demonstrated by extending the Attempto Controlled English (ACE) with polysemous and procedural constructs resulting in a more natural CNL named PAO covering narrative multi-domain texts.|102--120|||||International Workshop on Controlled Natural Language||gruzitis2009polysemy|||||||||||inproceedings|||dissertacao-2024.bib
A preliminary approach to the automatic extraction of business rules from unrestricted text in the banking industry|Jos{\'e} L Mart{\'\i}nez-Fern{\'a}ndez, Jos{\'e} C Gonz{\'a}lez, Julio Villena, Paloma Mart{\'\i}nez|2008|This paper addresses the problem of extracting formal statements, in the form of business rules, from free text descriptions of financial products or services. This automatic process is integrated in the banking software factory, permitting business analysts the formal specification, direct implementation and fast deployment of new products. This system is fully integrated with the typical software methodologies and architectures used in the banking industry for conventional development of backoffice or online applications.|299--310|||||Natural Language and Information Systems: 13th International Conference on Applications of Natural Language to Information Systems, NLDB 2008 London, UK, June 24-27, 2008 Proceedings 13||martinez2008preliminary|||||||||||inproceedings|||dissertacao-2024.bib
Lexicalized ontology for a business rules management platform: An automotive use case|Nouha Omrane, Adeline Nazarenko, Peter Rosina, Sylvie Szulman, Christoph Westphal|2011|This paper describes a platform that helps industrial domain experts to preserve the connection between textual sources and formalized business rules by using lexicalized ontologies both for links and for storage of the conceptual knowledge. Business Rules Management Systems (BRMSs) are used to update and query business rules of an automotive use case. They rely strongly on domain ontologies, which model the business knowledge and provide a conceptual vocabulary for the formalization of the rules that are expressed in written policies. We show that lexicalized ontologies are a key component of such BRMSs and how such knowledge can be encoded. Our proposed solution supports domain experts in the automotive industry in understanding and maintaining their business rules by presenting the relevant source documents that were used to create the ontological concepts. The use case is based on a car development scenario that models the connection between car testing scenarios, e.g., safety tests, and the methods and tools used to analyze and prepare these tests. The intended solution has been developed in the ONTORULE project and is still work in progress.|179--192|||||Rule-Based Modeling and Computing on the Semantic Web: 5th International Symposium, RuleML 2011--America, Ft.

A frame of reference for research of integrated governance, risk and compliance (GRC)|Nicolas Racz, Edgar Weippl, Andreas Seufert|2010|Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) is an emerging topic in the business and information technology world. However to this day the concept behind the acronym has neither been adequately researched, nor is there a common understanding among professionals. The research at hand provides a frame of reference for research of integrated GRC that was derived from the first scientifically grounded definition of the term. By means of a literature review the authors merge observations, an analysis of existing definitions and results from prior surveys in the derivation of a single-phrase definition. The definition is evaluated and improved through a survey among GRC professionals. Finally a frame of reference for GRC research is constructed.|106--117|||||Communications and Multimedia Security: 11th IFIP TC 6/TC 11 International Conference, CMS 2010, Linz, Austria, May 31--June 2, 2010.
